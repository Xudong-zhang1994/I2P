# I2P
This project is for practice. It usually includes my notes and practicals for the module. Hope to solve the difficulties as quickly as possible.
## Here are some tips:
1. Don't be afraid of programming.
2. Learn everything that you could get.
3. Stay calm!
4. Be confident!
## Also, you could add any question here to remind you:
1. "Work out how to compare the original and edited versions of README.md in your browser." How to do that?
