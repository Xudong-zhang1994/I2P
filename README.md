# I2P
This project is for practice. It usually includes my notes and practicals for the module. Hope to solve the difficulties as quickly as possible.
## Here are some tips:
1. Don't be afraid of programming.
2. Learn everything that you could get.
3. Stay calm!
4. Be confident!
## Notes:
1. When we want to define a file that could use **markdown**, we need to add  **.md** after the name we creat to the file.
## Also, you could add any question here to remind you:
1. "Work out how to compare the original and edited versions of README.md in your browser." *How to do that?*
